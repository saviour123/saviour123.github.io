    <h2>Write A Good Email</h2>
    <p>Content Blocked?
Why? I want to browse, I want to download this  Korean series. Sophos is getting annoying. Almost every site is blocked on campus( UG ).</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot 1" src="static/img/{}.png" />
That is the complain of most of us when browsing. Why not stand out and have your way freely amidst Web Protection. I would explain in details web protection and would suggest simple tricks to bypass this Sophos things.[Introduction, UG WEB, Advantages, Solutions, Recommendations]</p>
<p>Internet security it’s an issue all of us must be concerned with regarding our ever presence on with our Phones and Computers. We must be personally concerned about the security of WiFi we are connected to, the website we are visiting- are they stealing our personal data and selling it out to others for money among others.</p>
<p>Privacy online is a right not a privileged. To avoid bothering you with a lot of Technical stuffs, let jump straight to business.</p>
<p>The University of Ghana has been face with a lot of Web Attacks (Hacks) recently. Several websites hosted by the university has been compromised in one form or the other. the IT staffs needs some level of restrictions and protection on the University networks in order to reduce the level of attacks. I believe the reason for  Sophos Snternet Security is the reason stated above.</p>
<p>The students and the other internet users on campus are in disagreement with the website blocks or restrictions. Simply because our downloads have to pass through a restricted server which filters off most of our online pirating works.</p>
<p>This however is a major issue to others while the hackers would find their way around. The tool to do this job is VPN(Virtual Private Network).</p>
<p>There are several VPNs for out there to use. Some are paid while others allow you to try it for a week or month etc. In all instances, we can bypass this annoying Sophos and use torrents as never before.</p>
<p>**The advantages of VPN include the following advantages:</p>
<p>Enhanced security. When you connect to the network through a VPN, the data is
kept secured and encrypted. In this way the information is away from hackers’
eyes.</p>
<p>Through a VPN you can browse the web in complete anonymity. Compared to hide IP
software or web proxies, the advantage of a VPN service is that it allows you
to access both web applications and websites in complete anonymity.</p>
<p>Unblock -websites &amp; bypass filters.</p>
<p>VPNs are great for accessing blocked websites or for bypassing Internet filters.
This is why there is an increased number of VPN services used in countries
where Internet censorship is applied.</p>
<p>Change IP address. If you need an IP address from another country, then a VPN can provide you this.</p>
<p>Torrenting allowed. VPNs allow you to torrent and makes your internet faster.</p>
<p>Better performance. Bandwidth and efficiency of the network can be generally increased once a VPN solution is implemented. Reduce costs.</p>
<p>**Solutions:
ZenVPN- It's a technology that allows you access Internet as if you were connecting from a different point in the world. This means, among other things that your local ISP/network operator cannot inspect or filter your traffic and that for any website or other service you will appear as having a different IP address.</p>
<p>Hotspot Shield - Hotspot Shield's free VPN protects your privacy, unblocks websites &amp; hides your IP so you can surf anonymously. There are premium and trial versions.</p>
<p>VPNUnlimited - This is what they: The primary goal of VPN Unlimited is not to download torrents, but to offer online security. There are limited cases when our technical team had to decrease the connection speed because of torrenting. We allow legal usage of P2P file sharing on US-California 1, Romania, Luxembourg, France, Canada-East servers. This is supported on both Windows and Mac</p>
<p>Cyberghost -If you want to surf anonymously, CyberGhost VPN is your best option. We hide your IP address and replace it with one of ours, which you will share with others. This
way, no one will know who you are, or even what country you live in. What’s
more, We don’t track or store any logs from our users, so your identity is a
complete mystery to us, too.</p>
<p>The choice and plan of VPN is dependent on your security expection and how much you are willing to pay. Hospot shield includes advertisements. However, zenvpn and VPN have no ads so you can give them a try before buying one.</p>
<p>For The free
I love the free edition because its for pirates. Zenvpn requires your email to download. After the first usage, you can just create another email and use just as all of them. VPN unlimited is also very good.</p>
<p>If you have money, just buy the premium edition and we flow.
Developers Must Eat.</p>
<p>The only way to enjoy internet freedom on Legon campus is to
set up a VPN service. Am currently running hotspot shield lite on my PC</p>
<p>LIMIT THE WEB, DONT ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO LIMIT YOU.</p>
