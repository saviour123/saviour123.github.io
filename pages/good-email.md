subtitle: Writing a good email is a sweet as a good essay well layout, you email may need some polishing.



Having worked with Google students email for while, I have realized a lot of people have to step up their email writing skills.

The following are some tips.

##Don't overcommunicate.

Keep messages clear and brief.Be polite.Check your tone- avoid the usage of jargons, shorthands. Read through your email before hitting send .

One, type your message before entering the email.  Be careful to type the recipient email address and pay attention to the spelling of the address.

Two, SUBJECT area, Use this column to get a suitable topic for your email. It should be related to you message. It should not be longer than four words.


>>Never Type All your messages in the subject area.  Its the baddest thing you can ever do to your email.

Three, Use cc- copy: it copies message to other people and its the same as typing multiple emails separated by comma, in the recipient column

bcc-blind carbon copy- this function copies message to people without showing their email to other recipients.

Always:

Open,  your email with salutations, and begin your body on a new line.

Conclude your email with words like with regards, cheers etc. also on new line

Eg.
