Hi all,

I get a lot of posts about lost or stolen phones, so I wanted to share a few tips with you on locating your android device.

I have use all and located my mum.s lost phone, dat is the good news.


1. AndroidLost or plan b.

This can be remotely installed from a PC with your android gmail account from Playstore.

Depending on your android version, install the plan b or android lost.

With android lost, navigate to androidlost.com

And see several commands including activating your GPS by just a text message.


This works even if your phone is stolen. U can remotely install it and track as well as getting text messages from your phone. Its a light wight app all android users must install.


2. Avast antitheft.

I said avast anti theft and not antivirus.

This also gives you a real time tracking and is best to install it before the phone get missing. It can prevent the phone from accepting a factory reset. Isn't this wonderful.

Next time u lost your phone. Run quickly to avast.com sign in with your account and see de location of your phone on map.



3. Android Device Manager.

I least recommend this but, install it as well because, so many meat cannot spoil de soup.

It allows u to see de location of urs phone or for tracking ur partner. All dat is needed is the gmail account of de particular phone and password. The software allows u to track the lost or other phone from another android device.


Pls. Note.

Go to location setting and enable it.

Install at least 2 of the 3 apps, they are all lightweight apps not more than 4mb from the playstore.

Also open and register your avast once you install it as well as the androidlost.

If your phone is missing, there is hope with androidlost or plan b, android device manager. And also try tracking the phone very early before your thief gets smart. Don't wait for your phone to be stolen before you secure it.
