Hi all,

I get a lot of posts about lost or stolen phones, so I wanted to share a few tips with you on locating your android device.

I have use all and located my mum's lost phone, dat is the good news.


1. AndroidLost or Plan b.

This can be remotely installed from a PC with your android gmail account from Playstore.

Depending on your android version, install the Plan b or AndroidLost.

With android lost, navigate to androidlost.com

And see several commands including activating your GPS by just a text message.


This works even if your phone is stolen. You can remotely install it and track as well as getting text messages from your phone. Its a lightwight app that all android users must install.


2. Avast antitheft.

I said Avast Anti Theft and not Antivirus.

This is by far the Robust Anti Theft app i have used. I have a Login console where you can
track and manage your phone life.
This also gives you a real time tracking and it is best to install it before the phone get missing. It can prevent the phone from accepting a factory reset. Isn't this wonderful. <em>Install, open and register your avast once you install it<em>

Next time u lost your phone. Run quickly to avast.com sign in with your account and see de location of your phone on map.



3. Android Device Manager.

Install this as well. Many soup cannot spoil the soup.

It allows you to see the location of your phone or for tracking your partner. All you need is the Gmail account of the target and password. The software allows you to track the lost or other phone from another android device.


Pls. Note.

Go to location setting and enable it on your android.

Install at least 2 of the 3 apps above, they are all lightweight apps not more than 4mb from the playstore.

 as well as the androidlost.

If your phone is missing, there is hope with androidlost or plan b, android device manager. And also try tracking the phone very early before your thief gets smart. Don't wait for your phone to be stolen before you secure it.
