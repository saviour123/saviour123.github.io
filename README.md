# Personal-Website

Upon several thoughts and seeing other developers with simple and cuter website, 
I have decided to give myself a more simple design.
This is an archive. You may want to give a feel. 

## Instructions
`git clone reponame` && `cd the reponame`

From the console.

`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

In your browser, open

Feel free to branch it.
