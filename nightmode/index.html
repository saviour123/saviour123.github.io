    <h2>Your Eyes on Phone</h2>
    <hr />
<p>While phones have become ubiquitous, it's undeniable that some unhealthy practices can harm us and also affect the device.
Our eyes are among one of the vital organs of the body. Days back our parents were always watching us play while cautioning us to avoid things that would affect our sight.</p>
<p>The emergence of computers and smart gadgets, that exposes our eyes to damage are one the rise and there is a need to protect our sight.
This blog would border on issues concerning how your phone affects your eye and how to prevent negative repercussions. Next week's blog would tackle your  matters on how your computer screen affects your eyes.</p>
<p>To start with, If you use your phone at night or wake up early to attend to messages flying in from WhatsApp, your email as well as news, you are currently not wasting your time.
I would review some apps available to reduce the bright light emanating from the phone at night or at darker places. All of us should not wear glasses!
Neither should we shed tears when no one has beaten us. The following recommendations should help.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eye protector
Are you used to using your Android device at night? Do you think the screen of your Android device is too bright to look at night? Now you have the Eye protector which makes the screen darker, it can protect your eyes effectively.
Main Features:
<em>Night Mode - When you have to read by a dim light, the Night Mode prevents your eyes from being irritated by the screen of your device
</em>Scheduler - Turns on/off Night Mode automatically.
All the colours in the Eye Protector are from eye doctors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screen filter
This app has the effect of reducing the blue light. When the eye is fatigued, lowering the default brightness of the smartphone is especially effective for people. The application is very simple to use. After installing the application, click the blue light Block button. The color matches your eyes (in sepia color and black and encouraged) and sets the blocking rate. The filter should always protect your eyes. There is a feature to run the app automatically when booting, if you find it cumbersome applying the filter manually. 
This app can be used to increase the effectiveness with the case while adjusting the default brightness of the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EasyEyes
Trouble sleeping? Device screen too bright even on the lowest brightness setting? Want to give your phone a warm look instead of that eyes' straining blue gaze you see at night? EasyEyes is the solution. Inspired by Flux for the PC, EasyEyes changes your device's color temperature and creates a screen filter to reduce eye strain when looking at your device at night. Looking at a lower and natural light source gives your body a chance to produce more melatonin, helping to provide you with better sleep. With EasyEyes, you can now look at your phone at any time of the night while keeping your eyes in an easy, restful state. 
Some cool features.</p>
</li>
<li>Profiles - Set EasyEyes to turn on automatically for sunset or sleep</li>
<li>Temperature Filter - Turn the blue gaze of your device with warm lighting.</li>
<li>Brightness Filter - Set the brightness level below minimum brightness.</li>
<li>Sunrise and Sunset Time - Set the schedule based on the sunrise and sunset.</li>
<li>EasyEyes Widget/Shortcut - Quickly and easily turn on and off EasyEyes. </li>
<li>Notification Actions - Quickly change settings without cluttering your status bar. </li>
<li>Tasker support integration (Action available in "Plugin" category)</li>
</ol>
<p>Common Issues: 
"The onscreen navigation keys are still too bright" - With the "lowest system brightness" option, the white keys will be dimmed down to their minimum brightness.
What makes EasyEyes different? EasyEyes focuses on simplicity. It was built to run without the need for setup while also giving the user the maximum amount of control and customization. </p>
<p>There are several app filters and the above 3 are some of the coolest. Grab one for free, you can purchase premium or donate to help a developer.
Finally, note that, even applying a filter screen of prolonged exposure is not good for your health. </p>
